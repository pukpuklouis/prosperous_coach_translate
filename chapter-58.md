## Slow down to speed up success

by Rich

A martial arts student went to his teacher and said earnestly, “I am devoted to studying your system. How long will it take me to master it?” The teacher’s reply was casual, “Ten years.”

Impatiently, the student answered, “But I want to master it faster than that. I will work very hard. I will practice every day, ten or more hours a day if I have to. How long will it take then?”

The teacher thought for a moment then said, “Twenty years.”

WHEN I FIRST MET STEVE CHANDLER, he told me I reminded him of his puppy, which would run around the house really fast. When it got onto the tile floor in the kitchen, its little legs would still run at twenty miles an hour but it stayed in one place like a cartoon character!

I was trying to do so much...

But I had it wrong. You see, space is where miracles occur.

And so I began to create space for myself.

And I slowed everything down.

Slow down your conversations with clients and you will notice things they can’t yet see. Slow down your intake conversations with potential clients and you will create space for them to delve deeper into their lives than ever before.

Slow down the time you spend preparing for a meeting with a new client and you will think of questions that no one has ever asked them. Slow down enough to get a sense of your client’s world before you meet them and you will be more present for them than anyone else has ever been for them.

Thomas Edison was a genius who invented the phonograph, the motion picture camera and the electric light bulb. But he was also a terrible fisherman. He used to spend an hour almost every day fishing but he never caught any fish.

If you are wondering why a genius would be obsessed with fishing when he was so bad at it, you are not the only one. Someone once asked him why he was such a poor fisherman. He replied, “I never caught any fish because I never used any bait.”

When they asked why he’d fish without bait, he responded, “Because when you fish without bait, people don’t bother you, and neither do the fish. It provides me my best time to think.”

It was definitely no coincidence that the world’s best scientist was also the world’s worst fisherman. Edison really got the power of silence, the power of space and the power of slowing down. And one day, fishing with a bamboo pole, he had the insight to try bamboo as the filament for the first ever electric light bulb.

Practice regularly setting aside time for yourself to do nothing. Put time on your calendar for committed, quiet, creative time. And practice making this time as important a priority as a meeting with a client.

Even coaches who are already thriving and who want to get to the next level can benefit from slowing down their enrollment process.
