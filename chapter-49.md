# The value of daily practice

by Steve

RICH GAVE YOU THE EIGHTEEN magical elements of a fearless coaching session (Chapter 30). I have never seen anything like that taught anywhere by anyone in the world of coaching.

Practice those components and you will become transformative.

But do practice them.

I gave you the Eighteen Fearless Disciplines that are proven to work in the art of client acquisition (Chapters 13 and 14). If you practice them.

If you are a coach, your work is good work, and badly needed by the client you don’t have yet.

Imagine that client going through life without support, without a structure for raising self-awareness, without someone to tell the truth to, without a prosperity guide or a spirit guide. Imagine that person not having any of those things because you decided not to practice today.

All this coaching success stuff is practice, practice, practice.


Your clients want you to lead because it gives them permission to be leaders in their own lives. Do not be afraid of stepping into your power as a coach.
