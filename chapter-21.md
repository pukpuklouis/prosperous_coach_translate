## Never take less than two hours

by Rich

A COACH I KNOW WAS shocked when I told him that I never spend less than two hours with a potential client. You see, he only ever spends twenty to thirty minutes in conversation with potential clients.

Dee Hock was the CEO of VISA, the first-ever trillion dollar company. He once said, “As a leader, I’ll never schedule a meeting for less than two hours. Anything less than that and the issue should be dealt with by someone else.”

I took that idea into my coaching. And I’ll never meet a potential client for less than two hours.
