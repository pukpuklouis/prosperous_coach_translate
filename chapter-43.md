## The best time to plant a tree

by Rich

COACHES OFTEN SAY TO ME, “I wish I could create such deep, impactful coaching conversations.” Or, “I wish I knew how to charge high fees for my coaching.” When I hear this I smile, because there was a time when I couldn’t do these things. There was a time when I was terrified to say my fees out loud. There was a time when I felt too intimidated to challenge the beliefs of the person sitting opposite me. There was a time when I barely believed I could be paid money for coaching. And it wasn’t so long ago.

I had spent my entire working life with organizations, and once a month money was simply transferred electronically to my account by my employer. Only a few years back no one had ever looked me in the eyes and handed me a check for my services. And I had never imagined that someone could smile and say thank you as they gave me their money.

When I lost my job in the British education system I used my final paycheck to spend six months living on a beach in Southeast Asia. It was there that I began to use the coaching skills I’d learned in my previous leadership roles to coach and support my fellow travelers.

I remember the very strange moment when someone first asked, “Can I pay you for this?” And I remember the even stranger moment when I first said “Yes...” and they handed me some cash.

The first amount of money I was ever paid for coaching was 200 Thai Baht \(that’s less than five dollars\). Fast forward a few months and I had signed up my first-ever monthly coaching client for ten dollars per month.

But I promised myself that I was never going back to work in an organization. I was never again going to have a boss. I was committed to being a coach. It didn’t matter what I was paid, I was going to astound people with the possibilities they couldn’t yet see for themselves.

I remember an early dream to have five personal coaching clients a year at $25,000 a client. I practiced saying this number out loud. I’d say it to the mirror. I’d say it to my wife. I’d say it to my friends. And with some trepidation, I began saying it to potential clients.

At first, nobody entertained this number. And I had to get creative. I helped someone write a blog to help pay my bills. And I designed smaller, three-month and six-month coaching programs. I even had a man from Greece pay me for a single hour of coaching that we split into four fifteen-minute sessions over two months.

And then, almost eleven months since I had begun saying out loud that I charge $25,000 for a year of Deep Transformative Coaching, a woman looked me in the eyes and asked, rather matter-of-fact, “How do I pay you?” She sent a check that day, enclosed in a lovely thank you card.

Fast forward a few years and clients now pay up to $75,000 to work with me one-on-one.

You see, my coaching is bespoke. This is a British word that historically referred to a man’s suit that was tailored precisely to the buyer’s specifications. My coaching is highly personalized and tailor-made. It’s the reason my clients pay in full and in advance for their coaching.

How I got here isn’t magic.

But it seems it isn’t for everyone.

The latest research states that eighty percent of coaches make $20,000 a year or less. And the majority of them are working part-time.

One of my Apprentices signed his first-ever $50,000 client within the first month of us working together. He billed $400,000 in coaching fees, with a few high-end clients, in our time together. He signed his first three $50,000 clients and then his first $100,000 client—and he still doesn’t have a website or a business card. The year before he hired me as a coach he billed $15,000.

And what was even more powerful than this were the results his clients began to generate in the world. In fact, one of his clients just met his goal to raise twenty million dollars for the first phase of his dream project. Suddenly his coaching fees don’t seem so large.

There is such power in this work we call coaching. And our clients get that. I have noticed that the thank-you notes I receive have gotten larger as my clients have written larger checks. Your clients are paying you to help them achieve their dreams. So help them dream big and stay with them along the course. Raising your fees is not hard when you can see the incredible results your clients are creating.

The best time in life to plant a tree was twenty years ago. The second best time in life to plant a tree is today.

Don’t wait. Coach people.

Don’t wait. Raise your fees.

Don’t wait. Make bold proposals.

Don’t wait.
