## 步驟 4: 提議

by Rich

在過去30天裡面你做了多少的提議，而提議裡面有多少的錢呢？

一個提議是你清楚的對一個人說，”跟我合作Y個月的費用是$X元”，這是在你發現到一個潛在客戶的可能有的激勵人心的願景所做的提議。這是一個當說出來之後只會到兩個答案的提議”要嘛！當然好！又或是清楚的不要”
A proposal is where you explicitly say to a person, “It will cost $X to work with me for Y months.” It’s a proposal when you find out what would be an inspiring vision for a potential client. It’s a proposal when you tell them, “It’s either a Hell Yeah! for both of us or it’s a clear No.” It’s a proposal when you say, “This is how you make your payment. We begin the moment you send the money.”

Most coaches have no idea how to make a proposal. A potential client asks, “What would it look like to work with you?” And the coach dives into logistics and hours and packages and options. Or they say, “Let me put something in writing and I’ll get back to you…”

Don’t be afraid of the money. It’s just a number. Some people will say yes. Many will say no. And either is fine because you can move forward once you have a clear yes or no. Most coaches are so afraid of a no that they won’t ever make a proposal.

“Rich, I loved this coaching session we just did together. How much do you charge?” “Well, let’s slow things down for a moment. Let’s find out if it would really be a great fit for us to coach together. I have five criteria that any client must meet. My clients must be inspiring, or have an inspiring mission. They must make, or be ready to make, a big impact in the world. They must be fun. They must bring along a challenge; I’m not looking for an easy ride. And they must understand the power of commitment.” I’ll pause to check in with the person in front of me. If they meet these criteria, I’ll let them know. And then I’ll go on.

“Would you like to hear a little more about how we could work together?” You see, I’m continually seeking permission to continue when it comes to a proposal.

Then, based on our conversation, I will map out how our coaching will support their dreams, visions and goals becoming a reality. I will add to our conversation stories of results my clients have achieved or outrageous goals my clients have taken on. I’ll share stories about my own goals and even my own struggles. I don’t want to hide anything from my clients.

And only then, if all of this is still a fit, will I talk “logistics.”

“This is how often we will speak or meet. This is how much support you can count on from me. This is how much your investment will be. And this is how you make your payment. This is what you can count on me for. And this is what I require of you, if we are to work together.” I will be very clear with them:

“Does this feel like we are rushing things? If it does, let’s slow things down. Because if this doesn’t feel like a fit, let’s call it a clear no for now. “Let me be clear: you do not need coaching. In fact nobody needs coaching. The question is, do you want coaching? Personally, I believe in coaching so much that I have had my own coach for years. But that’s because I love having someone who believes in me. I love having someone hold me accountable to a bigger vision. I love someone who doesn’t believe in the negative stories I tell myself or the fears that hold me back. Not everyone wants that.

“Basically unless this is an absolute yes for you, let’s leave today being totally clear that it is a no. That way if the desire begins to build in you to be coached you can come back to me. But only when you are ready. “And if you decide you’d like to begin, the moment you make your payment you are in. Here’s where you send your check...”
