## Strength comes from getting uncomfortable

by Rich

Do one thing every day that scares you.

Eleanor Roosevelt

A POTENTIAL CLIENT ONCE ASKED me, “Rich, is there a way to coach me so I can pay your fee with no hesitation?”

I replied, “I want you to have hesitation before you begin coaching with me. This isn’t supposed to be an easy decision. This is supposed to be one of the biggest commitments you’ve ever made. This is supposed to have you lean right into your edge. You do not need my coaching. And if you want to coach with me, you will find a way for that to happen.”

In my experience, the more my clients commit, the more they achieve—because they are fully engaged. So if you wish to create a coaching practice with high-end, high-performing clients, you have to be willing to challenge them to make a big commitment in order to sign up with you.

Get comfortable feeling uncomfortable and your world will change.
