Rank each item below from 0-10

(Where 0 = I’m nowhere near... & 10 = I’ve nailed it!)



1. **Outcome Goals:** An outcome goal is bold and audacious and gets me in action. I understand that the only other purpose of an outcome goal is to have me feel amazing in this moment. I have an outcome goal that both excites me and scares me. (Example: I call one potential client a day. Or I make three bold requests a week)
2. **Process Goals:** A process goal is clear and achievable in a fixed time period. I have clear process goals for the next ninety days, so that each morning and week after week I know where to focus my time, my energy and my attention. I have habits and rituals that support and renew me on a daily/weekly basis. (Example: I call one potential client a day. Or I make three bold requests a week. Or I spend ten minutes planning my day before I check email.)
3. **Mindset:** It’s OK to feel nervous or scared (that’s called being human) but I commit to never let my fears, doubts, limiting beliefs or insecurities hold me back from taking action. I seek support in crafting a set of empowering new beliefs to help me create the next stage of my life.
4. **Skillset:** I understand that confidence is a result, not a requirement, and I continually upgrade my coaching skills and my business skills. I have identified any other skills I need, such as public speaking or writing, and I work on them regularly.
5. **Energy:** I know what people, places, habits and things fill me with energy. And I know what people, places, habits and things drain me of energy. I actively remove those energy drainers from my life.
6. **Creativity:** I spend time each day/week being creative. I use my creativity in enrolling clients and also in coaching clients. I am turning an ordinary business into an extraordinary business.
7. **The Art of Deep Coaching:** I provide exceptional value to clients. I vulnerably lead my clients in the most powerful way possible. I am committed to serving, not pleasing, my clients.
8. **The Art of Creating Clients:** I sell the experience of coaching, not the concept. I create deep, powerful coaching experiences for potential clients. I adopt an attitude of service. I leave conversations in possibility, not affordability. I grow my practice by invitation and referral only. I love creating clients as much as I love coaching clients.
9. **Getting the Value of Coaching:** I have my own coach so I can do the deep inner work needed to see my own blind spots. I know that I can’t take my clients any deeper than I have been able to go in my own life. I model for my clients just how much I believe in the power of coaching by paying for my own coaching. I pay my coach more money than I feel comfortable spending.
10. **Being Unique:** I have discovered what I am best at and enjoy doing that is different from what my peers are doing and that requires relatively little effort from me. I put huge effort into honing my skillset, so that it becomes extraordinary.
11. **Service:** I regularly ask the question: Who can I serve today? I regularly send referrals to colleagues.
12. **Time vs Money:** I complete every task I start. I work towards big goals one tiny step at a time. I understand that discretionary time is far more valuable than money.
13. **Integrity:** I’m impeccable with my word. I keep my word to myself and others. I clean up immediately when I don’t keep my word.
14. **Authenticity:** I’m willing to discover, confront, and tell the truth about myself-whenever and wherever I catch myself not being genuine, real, or authentic. I own my inauthenticities with my clients, too.
15. **Committed to Something Bigger than Myself:** I am committed to something bigger than myself that allows me to continue in the face of impossible hurdles and barriers. I get that no amount of money, fame, position or power will ever be enough. And I understand that life brings true joy when I am used for a purpose that I know is a mighty one.
16. **Thought Leadership/Influence:** I make my unique talents more unusual and more impactful every year. I build a body of work. I develop intellectual property that I share to help others use these skills. I am willing to risk disapproval in sharing my unorthodox way of seeing the world.
