# Fear and excuses

Here’s how you handle some of the most common thoughts that stand in the way of succeeding as a coach.

**They can’t afford it.**

You have no idea what they can afford. Stop making up stories. I have seen people say they can’t afford coaching and then go on holiday for three weeks. Give them the best coaching experience they have ever had and let them choose where they will invest their money.

**I’m not worth that much.**

Your “worth” is irrelevant. Coaching changes lives. And their dreams are priceless. Put all your attention on the value they will get from coaching.

**I don’t know how to set fees.**

Pick a number. Raising your rates is the easiest thing in the world. For now, pick a number, preferably two. And practice saying it out loud until it rolls off your tongue like your phone number.

**I don’t know who to speak to.**

Call an old friend. Call a colleague. Go to a social event. And put yourself in a service mindset. Give instead of take.

**I need a client.**

If you can’t pay the rent you don’t need a client, you need a job. Forget coaching. Find a way to create income immediately. You will never create high-end clients from a needy place. Once your basic expenses are covered and you no longer ‘need’ a client you are in a perfect position to start coaching again.

**I can’t afford my own coach.**

If you don’t believe enough in coaching to invest in your own coach, why would anyone ever invest in you? Find a way to save what you need for the very best coach you can afford. Model what it takes to your own clients.

**I keep getting no’s.**

Awesome! Play the NO game (see Appendix 5). But if you only ever get no’s, it either means your coaching is not powerful enough or you are in too much of a rush. Creating high—paying clients cannot be rushed.

**I don’t know how to get into the corporate world.**

Start with what you know. You have a background in accounting, law, marketing—then seek out the people you know because you know their secret dreams and their secret fears better than anyone.
