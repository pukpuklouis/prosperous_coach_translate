# Always be creating clients

by Rich

Good counselors lack no clients.

William Shakespeare

NEW COACHES OFTEN HAVE no idea of the boom-bust cycle that most coaches face.

They work hard to enroll their first few clients and then, with a sense of pride, they dive into their coaching together. After a few months, these clients gradually complete their coaching agreements and suddenly the coach (who had been thoroughly enjoying their life and business only a few weeks before) discovers that they are now back to having no clients. And no income. And they have to begin the cycle all over again.

This is tiring. It is draining and dispiriting.

So what if you were always creating clients?

A new coach recently took a trans-Atlantic plane ride from London to Los Angeles. He told me that he chatted with the guy next to him on the plane. This man turned out to be an actor and he ended up coaching him during the flight. He also coached one of the airline stewardesses. When he arrived in LA and an immigration official discovered his job, he even coached the officer for a few minutes. He was very excited as he told me all of these stories.

And then I asked him, “Did you tell any of them to call you when they get home? Did you get an email address? Or a cell phone number?”

He looked sheepish because the thought had never crossed his mind.

Clients of mine have created their own clients in the line at the supermarket and sunbathing on the beach. Friends of mine have created clients on airplanes, in trains and in taxis. You see, potential clients are all around you. The only thing they need is an experience of you and an invitation.

I met a woman in an airport and we began to talk. She asked what I do and I explained that I am a coach. We had a great chat and we swapped emails. A week later she sent me a message saying she had looked at my site and loved what I am up to. She said, “Let’s meet up for a chat over coffee.” I replied, “I don’t really do chats. But if you would like to experience a deep coaching conversation, then call me. I will block out two hours for you for a powerful, life-changing experience...”

“Always be creating clients” is not about hard work. And if it feels like work then it’s time to change the way you approach it.

It’s more about a perspective on life. It’s a reminder that all around you are people you can serve. There are people all around you who would love your support. Your only job is to ask if you can help.
