# No such thing as plural

by Rich

YOU ONLY EVER HAVE one client to worry about.

This client.

The one in front of you right now.

One of the biggest mistakes coaches make is to think in terms of plural.

Singular is all there is.

The client in front of you right now.

Really deeply see, in the most relaxed way possible, that there is only one person to converse with and enroll into your coaching. Choose that person slowly and wisely, and focus your life on her life.

Then create a safe space and be the first and only person in years to deeply desire that she shares everything with you.
