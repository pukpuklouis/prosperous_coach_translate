# Learn to enjoy enrolling

by Steve

TO BE GREAT AT SOMETHING, anything, you must eventually enjoy the process from top to bottom.

If you never enjoy it, you are never going to be great at it. Even if you have a good month here and there, it will never feel natural, and you will slide back into despair sooner or later.

We are always good at what we enjoy, and we always enjoy what we’re good at.

Then what comes first, enjoying it or being good at it?

It happens together. As skill improves so does enjoyment, and as enjoyment increases so does skill. Joy and strength arise simultaneously for the person who stays in action long enough.
