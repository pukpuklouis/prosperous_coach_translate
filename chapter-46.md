## It’s time to lead

by Rich

Gentle in what you do. Firm in how you do it.

Buck Brannaman The Horse Whisperer

JAMES WAS A POTENTIAL CLIENT. He asked to have a session with me. And then he cancelled. By text message. I was willing to reschedule and suggested two alternatives. But then I received his email:

Mondays and Fridays are very tight. Mondays I’m only free between 10:05am and 1:15pm and Fridays I’m only good between 9:30am and 1:00pm. Try again. This was not the sign of someone who was committed to a coaching experience with me. It was time to do what I call firing a potential client. I have a rule of thumb for life: Hell Yeah! or No. And potential clients who are not yet a Hell Yeah! for a conversation with me are not where I choose to invest my energy.

Sometimes it’s just great to help those people become either a firm yes or a firm no.

So I resisted the urge to send a long email and wrote:

Call me. I need 5 minutes of your time. That’s all it will take. When he called, I explained that for the moment we should take this session off the table. Maybe coaching wasn’t a priority for him right now. And that was fine. I just wanted us both to be clear.

Well, sometimes people surprise me. He replied, “Oh no. I really value the time with you. I don’t want to give the impression that I am not interested. How about if I send you my calendar, so you can pick the time for our call?”

Ten minutes after our conversation, I received this message:

Rich - Next week I am free on Tuesday all day and into the evening. Wednesday I’m free until 2:00. The following week I am again free Tuesday and into the evening. Wednesday I’m free until 4:00. Thursday I’m free until 2:00. Friday I’m free between 9:30 and 12:00. The week after that I’m free the same times on M,T,W and Th. Your clients want you to lead because it gives them permission to be leaders in their own lives. Do not be afraid of stepping into your power as a coach.
