## 好吧，我們來做個大膽的承諾：這個真的會帶來客戶

By Steve

我們稱這個為18個無畏的原則，因為這些代表著真的行的通的作法（但需要你實際運用。） 記著，你不光是要明白這些原則，不光是同意這些原則，不只是認同這些原則。而是真的運用它。

這些原則不是個理論而已我們知道這是行的通的。這些原則可以回溯到過去，我跟瑞奇還有我的客戶們，我們一起運用了這些原則好多年。我們在其中都有很大的收穫，直到今日我們都依然運用它。

我們先大概的描述這些原則，然後我們會在下一個章節仔細的解釋它們。

1. **賣給他們的是指引的體驗而不是教練的概念**，好讓到客戶只需要選擇要不要繼續給你指引。
2. **絕對不打陌生電話**，只透過熟識的人介紹。
3. 快速行動。**明白激情衝動的短暫性**。
4. **不要使用email**(特別是說服或是對質的時候)在跟新客戶開始對話時，可以的話盡量用電話或是面對面。
5. 善用聊天. Schedule conversations. Fill the day with conversations until your client list is full.
6. Use certainty versus belief. Speak from what you are certain of. Keep a success list.
7. Share stories and case histories versus features and benefits.
8. Find the goal behind the client’s goal. Ask about your client’s clients.
9. Needy is creepy. Stay with their wants versus your needs.
10. The Lamp Post Metaphor, from Michael “Neill: Be the first and only totally committed listener in their lives.

    Maintain innocence in getting your yes/no. Yes lives in the land of no. If they have to “go think about it” the conversation was not complete.

    Leadership in the close. Direct all the action.

    Slow down. All the wealth you want is right there in the next conversation. Don’t have a huge to-do list, just be with Who’s Next.

    Get a coach. A coach without a coach is like a doctor who won’t see a doctor. Get a coach who will build your practice and change your professional life.

    Leave the conversation in a context of possibility, not a context of affordability.

    Limitation creates value. Make sure you are the one doing the auditioning of the client, and not the other way around.

    Be constantly aware of role reversal. Do not surrender your power, leadership and role as the coach in the conversation.

    Be great at what you do... not just good. Have routines, habits and practices that guarantee that you become better and better as a coach every day. Read books, see movies, listen to audio and talk to people who make you better as a coach. Every day.

No high-performing client was ever created outside of a conversation. And no high-paying client was ever created outside of a powerful conversation.
