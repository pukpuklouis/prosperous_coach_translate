# Think exponential versus incremental

by Rich

Exponential growth looks like nothing is happening,
and then suddenly you get this explosion at the end.

Ray Kurzweil

THE DICTIONARY EXPLAINS THAT something is said to increase exponentially if its rate of change is very rapid. Conversely, the definition of incremental is a slight, often barely perceptible increase.

The problem is that most coaches are playing an incremental game.

They raise their prices from $100 a session to $120 a session.

They spend hours designing websites that make them look like every other coach.

They are more concerned about the graphics on their business card than where their next client will be.

A few years ago I began my coaching career by setting a goal to offer a thousand free Instant Confidence sessions. I began to tell people what I was up to, and within three months I had run four hundred sessions with people from all over the world. Truth be told, I thought I had a clever way to get clients. I later discovered that things don’t work that way. Free thirty-minute sessions were always unlikely to be a way for me to create year-long, paying clients.

However, something unexpected occurred: I coached four hundred people in less than ninety working days and, boy, did I build my skills exponentially as a coach.

A few years later I spent a day with a coach, sharing the principles in this book. He immediately began applying them. A week later he signed his first $50,000 client.

Nobody said that change has to be slow or even hard. To live an exponential life, you have to be willing to do things differently and be open to the possibility that everything you want is closer than you think.
