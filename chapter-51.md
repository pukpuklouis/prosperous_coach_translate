## Stay focused on what helps people

by Steve

STAY FOCUSED ON THE help that your making money will be for others.

Choosing to make good money and choosing to really make a difference in people’s lives will be the same thing. They go together. You can’t pull them apart.

So just keep focusing on those good actions you’re taking, and on the proposals and invitations you’re making, and figure out ways to sit down and be with people, so they can experience you—not just the idea of you.

Become more than a concept.

Start enrolling and coaching folks now.

And please know that this in turn benefits others, your clients, much more than it benefits you, because had you not enrolled them they would have spent that money on something that does not grow and transform them, often something misguided and foolhardy. They \(looking at the statistics\) would not have saved that money.

So when they hire you they have now truly invested in the one and only surefire investment there is: their own growth as an effective human.
