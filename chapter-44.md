## Don’t be a wallflower: Tell your story

by Steve

“I DON’T USUALLY TALK ABOUT my accomplishments.”

That’s what a coach \(now a good one!\) told me a couple years ago when he was just learning to get clients.

I was not easy on him when he told me that.

In fact I said to him, “Bingo! Check your bank account. Go online right now and look at it. Or call your bank and ask what the balance is. Because you can trace the amount of money to the words you just said: ‘I don’t usually talk about my accomplishments.’”

If I am your prospective client and I’m thinking about working with you, I want you to be proud of your accomplishments, and I want you to be easily conversant about them.

Because it gives me confidence in my decision to work with you.

It makes my decision so much easier. Not only that, it makes our work together more effective if as the client I’m not wondering if this humble guy, this “nice person” coaching me has any power, skills or moxie at all.

I will question your value when you are self-effacing and shuffle around the floor with your head hung low in a hang-dog, “little ol’ me” countenance.

I want a coach who knows who they are. Who knows how good they are, who knows their accomplishments and who isn’t at all shy or uncomfortable talking about them.

If you can’t freely discuss your accomplishments in a relaxed and enthusiastic manner, how can you possibly be the coach who can change my life?

Finally, by not talking about your accomplishments in colorful ways you are not being fair to me, your prospect.

You aren’t giving me enough to go on. So I probably won’t decide to work with you. And therefore, in the name of maintaining a certain safe, shy and humble “personality,” you are denying people a chance at transforming themselves and solving their problems.

So step up and be bold. For their sake and yours.

Drop all that fear-based, fake humility and stop trying to win friends and influence people. Instead, step up and change a life.
