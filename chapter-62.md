# Fail and fail and then fail more

by Rich

I’ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times, I’ve been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.

MY FRIEND CHRYS IS currently training for his third dan black belt in Kempo Ju-Jitsu, one of the toughest martial arts on the planet.

Many years ago, four friends (including Chrys) and I showed up for our first martial arts class. We all did well and we loved training and we took one grading after another. But gradually each of us hit a plateau. A moment where we couldn’t seem to improve, no matter what we did.

And within five years, one after another, we quit.

Chrys didn’t. He stayed in the game. He’s been training in this martial art for over twenty years now and he’s pretty incredible at what he does.

But twenty years ago Chrys was no better than any of us. Actually, he laughs that back then he cared less about the gradings than any of us (which is probably a big part of his secret).



If you want to be successful as a coach then get ready to stay in the game. There will be times when nothing seems to work. Stay in the game. There will be times when everyone is saying no. Stay in the game. There will be times when you seem to make mistake after mistake. Stay in the game.

I used to think the key to success was to do my best. But (as usual) I had things the wrong way round. Samuel Beckett got it right when he said:

**Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter.
Try again. Fail again. Fail better.**

Sometimes I will challenge my Apprentices—who are already thriving coaches—by saying that we will have no coaching session next week if they don’t screw something up in the next seven days.

Safety is the enemy of success. Be proud of your mistakes. Take a risk. Fail spectacularly. And then go out and fail some more.


Build your self-esteem. Clients like it when you have it. It reassures them that they have picked the right person.
