## Stop schmoozing

by Steve

SCHMOOZING: present participle of schmooze \(verb\). 1. Talk intimately and cozily; gossip. 2. Talk in such a way to \(someone\), typically in order to manipulate, flatter or impress them.

The Oxford Dictionary

SCHMOOZING, CHATS, LONG LUNCHES and social time confuse your client into thinking that coaching is a lot of friendly chatting together... And why do they want to pay for that?

Take the three hours you will lose traveling to lunch, having lunch and traveling back from lunch and put them into a powerful intake session.

And notice this email, just received from a coach who gets it:

I signed another new client. She came to me as a referral from a friend that I spent four hours with coaching for free. I really slowed down with my friend, gave her the best I have and asked for nothing in return. I only served. Then two days later she referred me to her friend. I slowed down and connected deeply and powerfully. In the past I would not have given myself the permission to take that much time with a person I did not consider a prospect on a work day. Thanks for the speaking the truth. The truth I spoke was a recommendation that this coach convert his focus from pleasing people \(and winning them over\) to fearlessly serving them right out of the box.
