# Coach and coach and coach

by Steve

I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.

Albert Einstein

YOUR ACTIVITIES ARE GOOD, but through all this good preparation and contact-making don’t forget to coach. Get a client NOW and start coaching, whatever you have to do to do that. Remember that you build a coaching practice by coaching people. No other way to do it. No reason to delay.

Get with people and coach them. Have long, long, involved phone conversations. No one will want coaching because of an email or anything like it. Just as a brain surgeon would not send emails promoting brain surgery.

Enjoy the fact that you are a coach now!

Take some interested person who has “no funds” and coach him for two hours. He’ll find the funds for more work with you.

Many of my most lucrative coaching contracts came from people who had no resources. Or so they thought. Until their lives were so profoundly changed by a long coaching session that they went to their Aunt Millie and borrowed money from her to continue working with me. Aunt Millie saw it as an investment in her nephew’s education. It worked for everyone.

Coaching leads to more coaching.
