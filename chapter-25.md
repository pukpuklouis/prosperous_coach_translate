# Learn to astonish your clients

by Rich

WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME you astonished a client?

It’s easy to lose sight of the fact that one of the most powerful ways to create new clients is to serve your current clients so powerfully that they never stop talking about you.

How could you astonish one of your clients today?

It usually doesn’t take much.

Call a client the day after a coaching call for a five minute catch-up. Clients love to hear from you when it’s not expected. Send a book to a client without telling them in advance. Offer to double the length of a coaching call, to really go deep with a client. Invite a client to a day-long, face-to-face session with you, instead of your usual one hour over the phone. Write a client a personal, hand-written note, right now.
