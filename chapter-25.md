## Sell the experience, not the concept

by Steve

WHAT DO I WANT MY INTAKE conversation, my long “getting-to-know-you” conversation with a coaching prospect to demonstrate?

I want it to demonstrate my curiosity, my love of coaching, my ability to relate a story or case history or two about people I’ve helped through coaching, my ability to listen, to relate, to get to the bottom of things, and my desire to convert dreams into projects so that my prospective client will stop wanting things and start engaging in the process of creating them.

Therefore I really want to take my time when I first talk to a client. And if my prospect has a website, blog posts or a physical place of business, I want to do good homework prior to talking to this prospect. That demonstrates commitment.

I always want to be the person who demonstrates what other people merely promise.

I have had many clients who could not “afford” me who ended up working with me because they sold something, or found a sponsor or benefactor, or got a loan, etc., so I learned never to factor in my own estimation of their ability to pay. I leave that up to them. People become really resourceful when they desire something. People usually get what they desire strongly in life. And I can only cause them to desire my coaching by making an amazing demonstration of what it can do for them.
