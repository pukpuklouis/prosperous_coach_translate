## They pay for more than the hour

by Steve

YOU MAY THINK YOU JUST got a client at a $400 per hour fee. But you did not.

Please keep in mind always that it’s not really per hour. She is paying for many hours of coaching experience when she writes you a check. Sometimes many years. When someone babysits, they charge per hour because you are paying for the hour they spend watching your kid. That’s it.

When people pay a coach like you they pay for everything you’ve ever done, because you’ll be bringing all that to the table. Not to mention all the books you’ve read, seminars you’ve attended and the other work you do \(including being coached in profound ways\) to make yourself the best coach you can be. So she’s paying for that, too.

A woman once saw Picasso doodle on a napkin in a restaurant and she went over to his table and asked him how much she’d have to pay to have that napkin. He said, “$20,000.”

She said, “What?!? I watched you, and it only took you five minutes to do it!”

He replied, “No, madam, it took me my whole life.”
