## Never propose marriage ten days after you meet

by Rich

THAT WOULD BE MY ADVICE to anyone who asked. Nope. Never, ever propose to a woman ten days after meeting her.

Except I did.

I met my wife at a workshop in San Francisco. And I knew I wanted to marry her nine days later.

I guess I like to take my time with life-changing decisions. So I waited a day!

Then I asked. And she said yes. And as I write, we’ve been together for six years.

Most of the time it’s never right to make a proposal to a coaching client very soon after meeting them. Building a powerful relationship is key. Often the vey best thing when you are enrolling clients is to slow down and really build strong relationships. Over significant time.

And yet every once in a while you just know...

Every once in a while, I’ll meet someone and I’ll just know: I’d love to coach you.

These days I’ll simply tell them that.

Steve and I have a friend who is a coach who fills his practice every year by writing a few handwritten letters to the five to ten people he would absolutely love to coach that year. Each letter is so personalized with so much attention on that individual that they cannot help but be moved by this man.

So: who would you love to coach?
