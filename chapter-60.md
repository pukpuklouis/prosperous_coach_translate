## No one ever pays for coaching

by Rich

MOST COACHES APPROACH potential clients with the view:

THEY have ALL the money. But I’m just me...

Successful coaches know:

They ALL have money. And there is no one else in the world like ME!

You see, no one is ever really paying for coaching.

When I meet someone interested in coaching, I ask them to tell me about their dreams. And then I help them to dream bigger than they have ever dreamed before. Then I help them see a way they can really, truly create that dream in their life.

I once had a session with a sixty-five-year-old woman who was exploring coaching with me. At the end of our conversation she cried. She told me she was crying because she had never shared her dreams with a living soul, including her husband.

So the truth is your clients are not really paying for your coaching. Or even for your way of being. \(Although both are important.\)

Your clients are paying for their dreams. And their dreams are priceless.

If the person in front of you has a big enough dream and they get that spending time with you will help them to achieve it, they will hire you.

When you put a client in touch with their dreams, they still have choice. After all, no one needs a coach. But if they really get that spending time with you will help them, your clients will find a way to create that money.

A new coach recently asked me, ”Is coaching just all about money?”

Here is something interesting I have noticed: the only coaches who ever ask me questions like that have no money.

No. Of course coaching is not all about the money. But the money you make is all about your coaching. Money is a result of your impact, your service and your creativity. Increase one or more of these factors and your life will transform. And so will the lives of your clients.

Money is a sign of the impact you are having in the world. More money in your bank account means you are making more of an impact. Bank account low? Find a way to make a bigger difference in your clients’ lives.

Money equals service. If you want to make some money, wake up and ask yourself, “Who can I serve today?” And then create a way to serve them even more powerfully.

Money is the most perfect expression of your creativity. If your bank account is low, it’s a reminder that it’s time to get even more creative.

Remember, too, that money is only good for one thing: it’s good for buying stuff. But most people want money for the feelings it will bring. So when money comes in, they feel good. And when it doesn’t, they feel awful.

Break that cycle quickly as a coach.

Stop tracking and celebrating your billings. They are out of your control. Instead, celebrate the amount of money you make in proposals. Proposals are in your control. Billings are not. Increase your proposals and your billings will follow.
