## Actively seek exciting clients

by Steve

ALWAYS KEEP YOUR EYE OUT for great clients—high-functioning people who want to go from good to great. Coaching comes from the world of sports and the arts, where athletes and actors receive coaching so that their work will become extraordinary instead of just okay. Coaching gives clients a secret weapon, a competitive edge that their un-coached peers do not enjoy. Coaching takes people from good to great. Coaching is not for dysfunctional people. It is not there to heal the sick and wounded. It’s there to help people reach their higher callings and unlived lives, the lives they are not living because they are trapped in their own isolated, self-critical egos. Coaching expands their world.

I could go on for a thousand pages about why coaching works and what it does and why it’s great and how unlike anything else \(including therapy\) it really is.

When I have a friend who is willing to refer a client to me I will insist that he \(my friend\) take a two-hour session from me first so he knows what he is talking about when he refers me. We will never sell coaching by selling the concept or the abstract idea of coaching. We must demonstrate it.

I know I repeat myself, and I know it’s fearless and good to do so.
