# Learn the beauty of a routine

by Steve

THE COACHES I COACH sometimes tell me that they have had a bad week or a bad month because they were “down” or discouraged or burned out.

They want to know how to change their attitude or mindset.

But attitude is not what’s missing.

What’s missing when bad weeks or months occur is a routine.

The beauty of a routine, a practice—a committed amount of time I devote to something no matter what—is that it does not rely on enthusiasm or “feeling like” doing it or the “spirit moving me.”

The routine of building a coaching practice through conversations is simple and it works. The only problem people have is with stopping. They do it for a little while and then get distracted.

If you want your practice to grow, design a routine. Then follow it every day. Then change the routine next week, but put a new one in place.

Your alternative is to check in with your feelings all day long to find out what you’re up for. This leads to financial disaster, in case you haven’t noticed yet.

The coaches I know who are failing have no system set up for success. They pretend they don’t know about routines or systems. It’s all about their mood and feelings. That’s what governs their actions. They have the professionalism of a toddler. They take their emotional temperature throughout the day to determine what they will or will not do. If you see yourself in this sad portrait, it may be time to throw your thermometer away and turn pro.
