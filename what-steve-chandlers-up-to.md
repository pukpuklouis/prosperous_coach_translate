What Steve Chandler’s up to:

# The Wealth Warrior Movement

Serve the world with what you love to do.

IN HIS RECENT BOOK, Wealth Warrior, Steve related his personal turnaround story: from underachievement, alcoholism, bankruptcy and shame to success, creative action and prosperity. In short, from wealth worrier to wealth warrior. Then, in the spirit of “If I can do this anybody can,” he shared inspirations that transformed his life–and showed how to put them into action.

Now Steve has created the Wealth Warrior Movement to enrich the message of the book. Through wealth tips, ongoing inspirations, and live webinars with Steve and special guests, he helps you cultivate a transformative warrior mindset. It is a program designed not just to help you create more wealth, but to truly prosper in all areas of your life.

As Steve says, “You and I, operating as creative, inspired individuals, can create the turnaround the world longs for. This yearning for new wealth will be satisfied one person at a time; one inspired individual at a time. I invite you to join this Wealth Warrior Movement and make it your conscious, active purpose to prosper and be a role model for others.”
