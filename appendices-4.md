Appendix 4

## Tracking sheet

EVERY WEEK MY CLIENTS EMAIL me with the answers to four questions. Pull out a blank sheet of paper and fill in your answers to these questions:

**Connect:** How many people did you connect with this week? \(Write out their names\).

**Invite:** How many people did you invite to a powerful coaching conversation with you this week? \(Write out their names\).

**Create \(Your Magic\):** How many people did you give a powerful experience of your coaching? \(Write out their names\).

**Propose:** How much money did you propose for coaching engagements this week? \(Write out the number in dollars\).

If you track these, over time you will build a thriving coaching practice. What gets measured gets done.
