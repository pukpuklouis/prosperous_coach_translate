# The end is really the beginning

by Rich

EVERY TIME I WATCH A Hollywood romance with my wife, I am amused that the credits begin to roll just at the moment the guy gets the girl, or just as they say their wedding vows.

My wedding day was one of the happiest moments of my life. But it was really just the beginning of my relationship. Monique and I have had ups and downs. We’ve faced challenges and we’ve struggled. We have moments when we can read each other’s minds and we feel totally in love. And we have moments when each of us wonders, “Why I am with this person who doesn’t understand anything I say or do?” (Plus, “Why oh why won’t he do the washing up like he promised?”)The way you create a thriving relationship—one day at a time and one conversation at a time—is also the only way to create a thriving coaching practice.

The end of this book is just the beginning of the next stage of your coaching practice.

Let go of any need for a “magic” system for creating clients. Instead, focus on the person in front of you right now. Ask yourself, “How can I serve this person so powerfully that they never forget this experience for the rest of their life?”

And be prepared for a miracle to occur.

mir·a·cle [mir-uh-kuh l]
noun
an effect or extraordinary event in the physical world
that surpasses all known human or natural powers

Here’s an example of a recent miracle I got to watch close up—and a great reminder to me that thinking I know the “right” way to do something is exactly what stands in the way of having more of my own miracles.

My wife, Monique DeBose, is an incredible singer/songwriter who helps people use their “small” voice to express their “Big” voice in the world.

She had been hard on herself because all the time she had put into raising our son over the first year of his life meant she might never get her career back. She was concerned she’d no longer be able to make money doing what she loves.

A while back we visited London and Monique arranged one of her Creative Vocal Improv events. She didn’t advertise it. She simply contacted a few people. And she only charged £10 per person.

Only two people signed up. And then one of them cancelled at the last minute.

Now the truth is, I myself engaged in a little bit of judgment: “Obviously” she should have advertised the event. “Obviously” she should have asked people to share it with their friends. “Obviously” she should have charged more...

Now, I have learned the first rule of relationships: never give my wife “advice.” So I chose to keep quiet. But I was actually quietly judging from the sideline.

When I got home that night Monique was crying and I was really worried until she told me that the one person who did show up brought along two friends. They were all so impacted by her work that they were literally moved to tears. It turned out that they all work for an extremely well-known media company. And, they said to her, “You should come and train our company. We really need you.”

One of those three women is in charge of training and they have invited her to train their company when we are back in London.

You know, life really can be exponential. You are far closer to everything you want than you could ever imagine. Miracles are far closer than you think. And there is no one “right” way to do anything in life. Woody Allen was correct when he said that eighty-percent of success is showing up.

Be YOU.
Because there is no coach like you in the world.
And that is priceless.
