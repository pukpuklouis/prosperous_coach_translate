## You can do this as a blue collar job

by Steve

NOT LONG AGO I GOT A MESSAGE from a friend who is a coach in Greece.

She asked me what to do “when my energy gets low, and my hopes do too??!! That’s how I feel today and although I know it will pass, a message about picking up the energy would be such a blessing!”

This was a wonderful question and I’m glad she asked it. In my non-prosperous years I would ask this question a lot. What do I do when I lose my hope and energy?

And then, in later years, because I had a rather wonderful coach, I was able to ask him the same question about what I should do when hope was gone. \(Which is why coaching is so great—you get to ask and solve anything and everything.\) He allowed me to see something.

If I have a game to play, my energy and hope are not problems. They are high. But if I have no game, no process goals, no scheduling of my own activities, then my moods plunge.

It’s similar to this: I used to coach writers and authors when they were struggling with “writer’s block” and not making progress on their books. Their hope and energy were low, so they did not write.

What I had them do was create a game, a scorecard, a schedule for logging the minutes or pages each day, with a win possible every day if they completed the assignments they gave themselves.

I would ask them, “Do you think truck drivers have this same problem? Is there something called Trucker’s Block, where a driver wakes up and finds his mood isn’t right for driving today?”

No. A trucker drives his truck no matter what his energy or hope levels are.

He has a schedule and a destination map, and he follows it no matter what.

So in coaching the trick for me was to find a way to make as many of my activities be lunch pail, blue collar activities as I could. So mood would not be a factor. Hope could come or go, it didn’t matter. My energy would be high or low and I’d still do what I set myself up to do.

That takes practice. Logging a certain amount of conversation and invitation time each day. Making a certain amount of proposals each week. Measuring my activities, not my results. Staying in the game.

It’s only when I think coaching success is different, fundamentally, than success at a blue collar job that I get confused and emotional about it.

It’s no different. It obeys the same principles.

The other day I asked a coach if she had any clients the previous day and she said no. So I asked if she had put eight hours into securing new clients into her business.

She said, “You’re kidding, right?”

Because to most new coaches that would be an absurd, ridiculous amount of time creating clients. Having conversations. Inviting and proposing. In one day? Eight hours?

Yet the person I saw today at the motor vehicle department goes to work and has conversations for eight hours every single day. What’s the difference?

The motor vehicle department employee is committed to keeping her job. The coach is obviously not. The coach figures she’ll try this for a few more months and if it doesn’t work out, she’ll just blame the profession itself.

Instead, engage people in conversations that serve them and you. You can’t be in a bad mood while you are genuinely helping another human being. The mind can’t do both things at once.

Put up an activity scoreboard. Make it a game. Declare destinations. Follow your maps. A trucker’s life works for you, too.

Life can be a full of hope and energy for all of us blue collar coaches.

Free advice is usually taken with a grain of salt. But a paid session can change someone’s life forever.
