Magical vs magic

by Rich

Magic is just someone spending more time on something than anyone else might reasonably expect.

* Teller \(of Penn & Teller\)

THE MAGIC OF FEARLESS COACHING isn’t in you, the coach. It’s over there in the person being coached.

The magic of fearless coaching isn’t about a style or a system. The magic is not in any one technique. You see, fearless coaching is not magic. But it is magical in its impact. Results will show you that.

Here are the key components of fearless coaching. Learn these, practice these, and your clients will thank you. And remember this: do not wait. Use them in your very first conversation with a potential client. Don’t save them until after someone has hired you.

They are most valuable to you when a potential client experiences their power right away, right there in that very first, long and extraordinary intake conversation.

1. Be bold.
2. Search for the Glimpse of Genius in the person in front of you.
3. Go deeper.
4. Be OK with silence.
5. Keep some of your attention on the inside.
6. Remember that the magic is in the person in front of you.
7. Pay attention to their words.
8. Lead powerfully.
9. Hide nothing.
10. God with a small “g”.
11. Come from Spirit.
12. Set a clear intention.
13. Seek permission.
14. Coaching creates miracles.
15. Invest in yourself.
16. Be YOU.
17. COMMIT.
18. Be willing to fail.
19. Be bold.

Say boldly what needs to be said. And hide nothing. You are not there to be their friend. You are there to create the most powerful coaching they have ever experienced.

As a coach, your only mission is to wake up each morning and ask yourself: “Who can I serve so powerfully that they never forget our conversation for the rest of their life?” When you serve people in this way you will become an extraordinary coach.

1. Search for the Glimpse of Genius in the person in front of you.

My clients tell me that one of the biggest gifts for them is that they know I always believe in them, even when they forget to believe in themselves.

The high bar you set for your clients has nothing to do with how much money they make, their job title, or the size of the company they work for. It has everything to do with your criteria for dream clients. My own clients are inspiring, and they make a big impact - or they are ready to. They are committed. They are fun. They bring a challenge to the table. And I ruthlessly seek out these criteria in any potential client I spend time with.

1. Go deeper.

Be on a relentless quest to go deeper than they ever imagined they wanted to go. Find their “secret dream”—the goal behind their goal.

You can only create extraordinary clients when you are willing to ask them questions that no other coach would ask. Dig deeper into their deepest dreams and their secret fears than anyone else has ever gone.

Every client has a goal behind their goal.

And no client ever comes to you for the first reason they present to you.

Your job is to find out what they really, really want. Do that and they will thank you forever. And you will have all the clients you ever want.

1. Be OK with silence.

Learn the power of the pause. It is one of the most powerful coaching tools.

Do not coach until you have a client in the room. Wait until you are certain what they really want. And know that if you are speaking more than they are, you are unlikely to uncover what is really going on inside them. If you don’t have a question to ask, say nothing.

1. Keep some of your attention on the inside.

What you are feeling on the inside is an incredible coaching tool. We are all deeply connected. So, keep a small percentage of your attention on the inside of your body. Slow down. Because what they are feeling, you are too.

1. Remember that the magic is in the person in front of you.

If you give them your absolute, full, undivided attention and you get really present, your inner wisdom will tell you where to go next.

Listening is the most underrated skill for a coach. You do not need to be an expert in your client’s life or business. They didn’t hire you to be a consultant. They hired a coach. I have coached CEOs, soldiers, Hollywood executives and Olympic athletes and I didn’t have to know anything about what they did in order to help them create remarkable results.

In fact, as a coach, one of your gifts is that you know less about their business than they do. So don’t be afraid to say nothing, or even to ask questions that seem obvious.

1. Pay absolute attention to the words of your client.

Because their language creates how they see their world. And how they see their world becomes their world. If you are prepared to listen deeply, their words will tell you everything that is going on in their world.

As a coach, when you meet a client whose behavior does not make sense on a surface level, you can know for certain that deep down there is a level at which the behavior makes perfect sense.

The results your clients are generating perfectly correlate with the actions they are taking. But if you can’t help them find out why they are taking those actions, the actions will never change.

Pay rapt attention to their words. Because their words tell you where they are focusing. Change their focus and you change their world.

1. Lead powerfully.

Refuse to buy into any story your clients may bring with them. Challenge how they see the world. They do not need sympathy. They do not need you to be their friend. “But this is who I am...” is not an absolute. It is a choice.

Coaching requires passion and authority. Never forget who’s the coach and who’s the client.

1. Hide nothing.

Show up fully expressed; show the real you. Hide nothing; hold nothing back.

1. God with a small “g”.

Notice just how powerful the person in front of you is. Put your attention on their power. One advantage of me spending so much of my own life feeling powerless is that I now quickly see how powerful people are. But this is something we can all do.

Your client is the god of their world because they create their own world. And they don’t even know it.

1. Come from Spirit.

This isn’t about you. Tap into something deeper. Your purpose. A higher calling. The universe. God.

You cannot be a powerful coach if you think this is all about you.

1. Set a clear intention.

Get clear on where you are speaking from and where you are speaking to.

Speaking from your head to their head is only one way to coach. Try speaking from your heart to their inner wisdom. Or from your gut intuition to their heart.

1. Seek permission.

The more safety you create, the deeper you can go. “Would it be OK with you if I ask a question about that?”

1. Get clear that coaching creates miracles.

And let your client know that. Set a powerful context for every coaching session. Increased expectations will call out the best in both of you.

1. Invest in yourself.

Because you can’t take a client any deeper than you have gone yourself. I have invested hundreds of hours and over a quarter of a million dollars to receive very deep coaching from some of the world’s most impactful coaches. I believe in the life-changing power of coaching because I have experienced life-changing, powerful coaching.

1. Be YOU.

Because there is no coach like you in the world. And that is priceless.

1. COMMIT.

Play FULL Out.

1. Be willing to fail.

Again. And again. And again. As Sir Winston Churchill once said, “Success is stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.”

Barbara Kingsolver wrote: “The very least you can do in your life is to figure out what you hope for; and then live inside that hope.” As coaches we can do better than that. Life really can be amazing. So why not have your clients find out what they really, really want—and then help them to create it. Hope is irrelevant. Coaching makes miracles occur.

John F. Kennedy once said: “The only reason to give a speech is to change the world.” It’s actually the only reason to have a powerful conversation with anyone. Fearless coaching means every time you coach, you change the world.

**Fearless Coaching in Action \#1**

A client who is a coach sent me a worried message. He was concerned that a potential client might not want to hire him as a coach after their first conversation.

I told him: Your worries are irrelevant to your conversation with him. Instead, put your attention on this man. Fully. And serve him so powerfully that he never forgets your conversation for the rest of his life. When you are done, ask about his relationship and his business and the amount of money he is making and his dating life and the legacy he wants to leave in the world... And then offer to help him with these things. Serve this man so powerfully that he never forgets this conversation for the rest of his life.

He may become a client right away. And he may not. But he might make a referral. Or he might come back to you in a year. Or two. Or three. There’s a longer-term game here too.

Don’t be afraid to use your intuition. Don’t be afraid to say what feels uncomfortable. Don’t be afraid to let the person in front of you acknowledge feeling uncomfortable.

**Fearless Coaching in Action \#2**

A client showed up full of doubt and concerns about her choice to move halfway around the world and begin a career as a super-yacht broker \(selling multi-million-dollar ocean-going yachts\). Our coaching session anchored into her psyche just how powerful she is, and within days of her arrival in a new country she had created connections with captains of super-yachts, successful boat dealers and owners of super-yacht boatyards.

In our next session she questioned whether I tell all my clients that they are powerful. “I do!” I replied. But purely because I only work with powerful clients. I set a very high bar for who I will work with. And I reminded her that she was one of these clients.

**Fearless Coaching in Action \#3**

I once sat down with a young woman who was a millionaire. In her early twenties she sold her first company for over a million dollars. Now in her mid-twenties, she shared her goal to make seven figures a year in online sales.

Smiling, I said that I wasn’t interested in coaching her around this goal. She seemed stunned and said, “But every coach I meet says they’d love to coach me!” “Of course they do,” I replied. “With your track record there’s no doubt that you’ll achieve that goal. But I only like to coach people around goals that make them feel truly alive.”

So I asked her, once you’ve got your $100K a month, what else do you want? And then we went deeper. What else? What else? What else? \(I am like a dog with a bone with this simple question—and I won’t let go until I see the sparkle in their eyes.\)

We talked for about an hour until she was overcome by emotion. With tears streaming down her face, she told me about the disease she’d overcome and its impact on her life. She told me how she wanted to inspire young women to live healthy, balanced lives. “Now we’re talking!” I said.

**Fearless Coaching in Action \#4**

I coached a well-known actor, who came to me one day very upset that her project had been given to an A-list Hollywood star, just as production was about to start.

You might think her anger and frustration were reasonable—she certainly thought so—and when I refused to buy into her story she was stunned. Instead, I explained that she had created a Perfect System for the results she was getting.

I took a risk and allowed this coaching session to explore deeply into her experiences, fears and beliefs. During the coaching she shared with me some traumatic situations she’d faced as a child. And as I went deeper still, we uncovered two deeply held—yet contradictory—beliefs. The first was, “I will be safe once I am successful.” And the second was, “If I really have success, people will take advantage of me.”

This first belief had led her to greater and greater success and even fame because much of her motivation came from the idea that the more successful she became, the less people could take advantage of her.

But the other belief of her Perfect System resulted—again and again—in opportunities being “taken away” from her at the very last minute. You see, if she achieved too much success she could really be taken advantage of and there was no way she would let that occur.

I suggested that when the studio executives told her, “Sorry, we’re giving this project to someone else,” she had just crumbled and accepted it because she was secretly relieved.

She didn’t seem to believe me.

Then I asked her what would have happened if she had looked them in the eyes and said, “I don’t give a _\*\*_ how famous the other actor is. She’s not me. No one has been through the experiences that I have. No one understands this project like I do. There is no one in the entire world who could play this role with the passion and tenacity and courage that I will bring to it.”

She looked at me, blinking slowly, and said, “Oh my God.”

And she just paused, in silence, for several minutes.

Finally she responded, “I really could have said that to them...”

It doesn’t matter who your client is, they are paying you to be one of the few people in the world who is willing to say the things that no one else will say.
