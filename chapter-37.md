## Push past the fear and get closer

by Steve

SELLING IS HARD WHEN we fear other people.

Coaching must become fearless to succeed in big ways. Coaching is all about courage and creativity. You can’t skip that.

If you feel distant from your prospect, you won’t sign them as a client. When you fear them, you cannot be direct. You have to think of how to best hint at your intentions or throw shallow, needy, pitiable info at them.

Coaching is not about “information.” It is about transformation. Change someone’s life and they will hire you. All other activities are weak-kneed and wimpy and will have you quit this profession in absolute despair.

Client enrollment becomes more fun and effective the closer we get to the other person.

One way to get closer is to put yourself in their place and give them the level of truth you would want.

Another way to get closer is to ask them all the things you wonder about them. Such as why they have not yet achieved what they say they want to achieve.
