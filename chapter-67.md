# You are the one you are looking for

by Rich

Don’t ask what the world needs.
Ask what makes you come alive, and go do that.
Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.

Howard Thurman

I SPENT MOST OF MY LIFE searching for a secret principle—or even a special teacher or leader—that would show me the way. You see, I was convinced that there was a secret way to be successful and happy at whatever I was doing.

I did meet many extremely successful and happy, world-class coaches. I tried hard to be like them. But it never quite worked. The more I tried to be like other people, the less authentic I became.

And it’s very hard to do what you love when you feel inauthentic. It’s very hard for people to be drawn to you when you don’t feel authentic yourself.

For most of my life, I thought that if I could be more like other people, well, then I would be successful. Then I would have a life that I loved.

What I slowly began to see as I got to know some of the world’s very best coaches was that none of them were trying to be anyone else.

And as time went on, the more I risked being myself, the more wonderful my life became.

Who knew that I had it the wrong way round for so long?!

Be YOU.

There is no one like YOU in the world. In a planet of 6.5 billion people, YOU are a very, very scarce commodity.

The more YOU you become, the more you will draw the right people to you.

The more YOU you become, the more fun your life will be.

And the more YOU you become, the more your clients will pay.

As Dolly Parton said: “Figure out who you are and then do it on purpose.”
