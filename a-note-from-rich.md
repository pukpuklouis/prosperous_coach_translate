# a note from rich

I’VE ALWAYS LOVED ADVENTURES. As a kid, I was an avid reader of adventure stories. And I camped across England, Wales and Scotland as a boy scout. I hitchhiked around Israel when I was seventeen. I traveled alone around India at twenty-one. I taught science in a rural school in Botswana at twenty-four. And I was once given a diamond-encrusted watch by the world’s wealthiest man.

I love to tell stories about my adventures \(just ask my wife\). But the truth is I have a very selective memory.

And like me, some of your best stories are probably about your most challenging moments. I have been robbed at knife-point. I was once so sick in Calcutta that I couldn’t move for four days. Another time I was terrified when charged by a rhino—to make it worse I was on horseback at the time and barely knew how to ride. Once I saved the life of a man about to be killed for stealing in an African village!

These days I am pretty good at making these sound like cool stories, but the truth is that over the course of my travels I’ve been sick and I’ve been scared and I’ve felt very alone.

In the years since I began coaching as a full-time career I have had some incredible successes and helped my clients do some amazing things. I’ve learned to create a coaching practice by invitation and referral only, with a few powerful, high-end clients. And I’ve helped many other coaches do the same.

So I have some great stories to share about how to create high-paying clients, but the truth is that—just like on my travels—along the way I’ve been sick and I’ve been scared and I’ve felt very alone.

So if you ever feel upset or sad or scared that you won’t be able to succeed as a coach, or that one day the magic will run out and the dream will fall apart, you are not alone.
