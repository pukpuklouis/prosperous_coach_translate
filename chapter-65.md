# Grow your professional self-esteem

by Steve

WHEN YOU LOSE CONFIDENCE in the value of what you have to offer, it gets harder and harder to ask for a good fee.

Because people ultimately pay you not what they decide your coaching is worth, but what you decide your coaching is worth.

Exchanging money is always an exchange of energy. Sometimes it’s just the energy of thought, but it’s still energy.

And it’s hard to bring that energy up from a place of low self-esteem. There isn’t a lot of energy down there!

So one of the best ways to keep your confidence and your sense of value high is to save and read your fan mail.

Any time you get an email complimenting your work, save it. Save all of the rave reviews for anything you do in a certain file. Keep a little journal or notebook. If somebody calls and thanks you or compliments you, jot it down.

Because there’s going to be a time next week or next month where, before you go into a very important call or meeting, you’re going to want to read through those notes and really get who you are.

We let our self-esteem slip.

By not paying attention to the subject. But self-esteem is destiny in this business. You can have low self-esteem at the Department of Motor Vehicles and still be Employee of the Year. It won’t work in this business of fearless coaching.

And sometimes it takes another person to come in and boost us and remind us how good we are. Sometimes our romantic partner plays that role and pumps us up before we have a big, important conversation. But don’t rely on that. Better to be in charge of that function yourself. After all, it is called self-esteem.

And clients like it when you have it. It reassures them that they have picked the right person.
