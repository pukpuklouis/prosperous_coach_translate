# Learn to suffer a little injury

by Steve

THE GREAT PHILOSOPHER Emerson said: “Our chief want in life is somebody who will make us do what we can.”

Well, that’s good news for coaches, because that’s our job description. Amazing that our job description happens to match up with everyone’s chief want in life.

So it helps to keep in mind that everyone wants what you’ve got.

Then why is it so hard to sell?

Answer: It’s not.

It’s just that for most of us (especially me) selling did not come naturally. It wasn’t learned in childhood. It certainly wasn’t learned in school (which usually teaches the complete opposite of free enterprise).

So we have to learn it as adults. And ninety percent of adults never learn it. It’s a brand new learning.

And why is that such a challenge? Maybe Dr. Thomas Szasz says it best:

Every act of conscious learning requires the willingness to suffer an injury to one’s self-esteem. That is why young children, before they are aware of their own self-importance, learn so easily; and why older persons, especially if vain or important, cannot learn at all.
Rich and I wrote this book to deliver this learning. To produce a safe and fun place to learn this exciting, challenging skill of enrollment that some call sales. We are here for one purpose, and that’s to teach it to you. You are not alone anymore. Highlight the parts of this book that scare you and wake you up. Go back and read them aloud every day. And put them into practice until you are independently wealthy.
