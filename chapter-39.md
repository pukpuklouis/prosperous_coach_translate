## The biggest mistake coaches make

by Steve

THE MISTAKE IS THIS: They don’t honor the person they are selling to. They place their own needs and fears ahead of the prospect’s.

They don’t enter the prospect’s life and solve a real problem. They stay inside their own offer and their own worthiness. They do this subconsciously, but they do it, and it pushes the prospect away. It makes the prospect defensive. Soon the prospect doesn’t even want to return a call.

If we can learn to love being in the prospect’s world and solving the prospect’s problems and bringing out the best in our prospect throughout the session, we will always look forward to this process we used to call “enrolling” or “selling”—because now we just call it “fearless coaching.”
