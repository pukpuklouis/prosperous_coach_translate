## Don’t charge for what you do

by Steve

YOU AREN’T BILLING FOR TIME elapsed. You are billing for the very real possibility of a goal being achieved that would not have been achieved without fearless coaching.

Your client has a default future that will occur on its own if his life does not change.

When he pays you he is paying for his life to change.

He is paying for his dream to be converted into a project. You will be the project manager. \(In businesses, good project managers make six figures.\)

If all you talk about is “per hour” and how long the sessions will go it demeans the real value of coaching. Your client has hired you because of something they want to do differently. They know deep down that it’s true what Walt Disney said: “If you can dream it, you can do it.” That’s what they will pay for.

Also remember you are charging your client for the breakthrough they wish to achieve instead of the “things they get,” like sessions, emails, spot coaching, in-person meetings, and so on. You can say that “at a minimum” you’ll get these, but you want to have your intake conversation establish the goal.

Maybe your prospect wants out of her career rut. What would that look like? Let her describe the rut to you. Have her really take her time to describe it, and all the feelings it creates in her. This is her default future. Now let’s talk about what’s possible. Help her see what might be possible through the work you might do together. And that possibility, that goal, that breakthrough is the product she is paying for. Would she pay you money to get out of that rut and learn to fly again, and to know how to always get out of ruts in the future? Of course she would.

Your client has a default future that will occur on its own if his life does not change. When he pays you he is paying for his life to change.
