# Truth is what clients value

by Steve

LET YOUR PROSPECTS KNOW WHAT coaching with you would be like by having your intake conversations be long, extremely real and truthful. You are selling coaching, so don’t mince words or do the dance of money-fear by flattering them, chatting them up or acting in ways that disgust your own heart and soul.

Instead, be willing to listen deeply and then be the first person in their lives to tell them the truth. Be real and tell the truth about how you really see their problems.

Remember, too, it’s not just a numbers game.

It’s not just the luck of the draw. “Talk to enough people and sooner or later one will cave in.”

It’s not that.

Just find one person and coach that person. Then move on. That’s really how coaching practices are built.

Don’t focus on massive numbers, because that takes your attention away from quality of listening, quality of conversation. It’s all about the next person you talk to, not the number of people you talk to.

Slow down and focus. Stay on the path.
