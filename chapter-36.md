# When you do use email, do this

by Steve

WHEN YOU DO SEND EMAILS, make certain they always contain value for the recipient and are not just requests that benefit you.

And when you check back with someone who is out there “considering” working with you, make sure your communication always offers a fresh new idea and added value, and is not just an attempt to check in.

In other words, because we are coaches gifted at creating transformation and delivering the tools of personal growth, we should make sure we never miss that opportunity!

We should never turn into someone who is just selling.

Although where possible we always want to upgrade our communication with a prospect from email to phone, from phone to in-person, from in-person to climbing a mountain together, etc., there are times when an email can be powerful. So don’t be afraid to have your email be strong and clear. Here’s one I once sent to a prospect, and it got me a coaching client.

  Dear Bill,
  You said you want to hold off on the conversation with me until you know what my “templates and approach” are.
  There is no approach, and no standard coaching template. You yourself are the agenda and you are the approach.
  We work on the lies, the self-deception and the fears in you about money, and about the power you perceive to be outside yourself in other people. We work on your difficulties with “making decisions” and inability thus far to make bold choices in life and follow through and trust yourself completely to do so.
  I have no coaching approach. Transformation is the only objective. And the irony for some people is that the very thing that they want the coaching for (an indecisive, half-hearted life) is what’s keeping them from deciding whether to get coaching.
  When you’re ready you’ll call me...meanwhile I am attaching an eBook I wrote called Powerful Graceful Success because I know it will help you to the next level.

  Focus on the person in front of you. Ask yourself, “How can I serve this person so powerfully that they never forget this experience for the rest of their life?”
