# Possibility will trump affordability

by Steve

ONE OF THE PRIMARY AND most oft-repeated mistakes coaches make happens when they allow the end of a long intake conversation to focus on fee. On price. On affordability. On cash flow. On money. On scarcity.

So the prospective client hangs up and then walks away inside the context of affordability. And that’s the worst place to end a call.

It’s the last context I would ever deliberately create, and yet I’ve created it! It would be like if I were single and dating and just had a wonderful flirtatious and connecting, meaningful conversation with someone I want to see again, and I end the call with, “By the way, I own a meth lab. You need to see it sometime.”

Please don’t let anyone hang up or walk out the door if the last words you exchanged were about money. It’s okay to go directly into the money issue, but then allow that issue to take you back to what your prospect wants and what his or her opportunities really are. You always want to leave your prospect inside the highest context of possibility.

Because about eighty percent of coaches end every call on the subject of money. Is that a total buzz-kill or what?

You’ve probably noticed that this is one of the Eighteen Disciplines—to always end the conversation on the highest possibility for the client, with the client doing the describing of that possibility. It bears repeating that when these disciplines are practiced, coaches become prosperous.


The coaches who are failing have no system for success. It’s all about their mood and feelings. They take their emotional temperature throughout the day to determine what they will or will not do. If you see yourself in this sad portrait, throw your thermometer away and turn pro.
