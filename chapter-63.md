## Why would a coach need a coach?

by Rich

Invest in yourself, in your education. There’s nothing better.

**Sylvia Porter**

ANY TIME I MEET A COACH who doesn’t have a full practice I ask if they have ever invested money in their own coach. Many \(too many\) coaches have not.

No wonder they struggle to create a thriving practice—they don’t believe in investing in their own coach but they want their potential clients to invest in one.

“Well, do you have a coach?” a potential client asked me, with a wry smile.

“Actually, I have three right now,” I said.

“What!” she exclaimed. “You’re a coach. What do you need three coaches for?”

“Oh,” I said, “I don’t need any of them. I want them…”

My clients get just how much I believe in the power of coaching when they hear that I’ve invested over $250,000 on my own coaching. And as I share my own successes, they are able to see the possibilities that coaching can create.

Find a coach that will be right for you. Don’t hesitate to ask a potential coach for stories of the financial, emotional and skill-building impact of their work. Ask for a deep experience of how they coach.

\(And as a cautionary note: research whether or not the coach actually does what they say they do. We have seen book-writing coaches who have never published a book, internet marketers who run coach trainings but don’t have any clients and social media coaches who have thousands of followers but no income. But these are stories for another book.\)

So, the truth is you don’t need a coach.

In fact, nobody needs a coach.

Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.

But if you want to increase your own impact and income as a coach, you might want one.
