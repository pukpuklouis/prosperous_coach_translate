## Don’t close a sale—open a relationship

by Rich

IT’S INTERESTING, AND RELEVANT to coaching success, how a woman once described the difference between meeting Gladstone and Disraeli in the week that they were both standing for election as the British Prime Minister.

She said, “After dinner with Gladstone, I thought he was the most interesting person in the world… But after dinner with Disraeli, I thought I was the most interesting person in the world…”

Disraeli won the election.

As a coach, be more like Disraeli.

Approach a conversation with a potential client from a place of being really, really present. Put all your attention on them and get curious. Ask questions about their life and their world. Ask about their dreams and desires, their fears and their pain.

And then, if—I stress if—you see a place where you could help, ask, “Would you like some support with that?”

I always come from a place of building relationships. I’m never trying to “sell” anything to anyone. Let me tell you a story about this.

While living in Beijing for a few months, I had a great conversation with a wonderful businesswoman. She was a successful entrepreneur, coach and consultant. And she inspired me with the reputation she had created for herself in working both with ex-pat spouses and also in the corporate world.

She asked for some support and I created a coaching session for her. We did some deep coaching but at the end of the session it didn’t feel like she needed ongoing coaching. So, as much as I would have loved to have worked with her, I chose not to even suggest that we coach together.

Now at that point if I had only been interested in closing a sale, I’d have crossed her off my address book and gone out looking for other people to coach.

Instead, I opened a relationship. Over the months ahead, I emailed to check in with her. I sent her an interesting article. And at Christmas when she asked for a little support, I told her to call me and I coached her.

In the eighteen months since I’d met her, we’d stayed connected but she’d never paid me a thing or become a client. Then one day, she came to my mind and I had an idea. I emailed and said, “I’ve been thinking of you and I have something that I think may be a great fit for you. Would you like to hear a little bit about it?”

She said yes and called me. I explored her dreams with her for two hours. And at the end we discussed coaching together.

Then she sent me a check—a year and a half after we first met.

Imagine if I’d tried to close a sale at the beginning and then walked away when that didn’t happen. Coaches do that all the time. They fail to see that this is a relationship business.
