## Extraordinary results are created by extraordinary requests

by Rich

THINK OF A CLIENT. Or a potential client.

Or a colleague. Or a friend.

Or someone you don’t yet know.

Now make an Extraordinary Request of them.

And then another.

And then another.

It will change everything.

One of my clients was an ex-military man. A soldier who was personal friends with CEOs, royalty and millionaires from all over the globe. He realized that many of the wealthiest and most successful men on the planet were simply bored. They were tolerating life. They had no real challenges remaining for them because they had all the money they’d ever need. However, there was still something missing.

So my client designed an extremely high-end program that would give men like this an opportunity to really face their edge. You see, these men were craving adventure. And my client’s military and personal-protection training made him fascinating to these people.

I helped him craft the enrollment for the program. There would be no website. For men like this it needed to be so exclusive that it had to be word-of-mouth only. And we were clear that the initial coaching conversation had to give them a full-on experience of what this program would offer.

He began to reach out to the men he knew. One person at a time. And then, each time he saw a place where he could support them in their life or on their mission, he made an extraordinary request. He asked one man to climb a mountain with him while he coached him. He invited another to swim across a freezing lake and another to join him on a helicopter flight. From that moment on, he had such fun inviting people to speak to him, that it was inevitable the people he reached out to would want to know more. And when they did, he made the boldest requests of his life.

Despite his military background and having spent a great deal of time in combat situations that would terrify most of us, his biggest fear was of having a sales conversation. It was initially very intimidating to have to share details of a program that included a fee of $150,000, paid in full and up-front. But even that fear began to transform over time as he made one extraordinary request after another.
