## Be okay to begin as a beginner

by Rich

In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities. In the expert’s mind there are few.

Shunryu Suzuki

WE ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH the grading system in martial arts where you receive belts for different levels of mastery. Master coach Brian Whetten helped me see that building a coaching practice has a similar system of levels of progression.

At the STUDENT level you are a training to be a coach. At the BEGINNER level you are a coach who regularly experiences the impact of coaching on your clients. \(You have coached at least fifty clients.\) At the NOVICE level you are a coach who is regularly paid for coaching. \(You have had at least ten paid individual clients.\) At the COMPETENT level you are a coach who can cover your monthly expenses with your coaching income. At the PROFICIENT level you are a coach who can create clients by invitation or referral only. At the VIRTUOSO level you are a coach who can create clients whenever you choose to. At the MASTERY level you are a coach who can take extended vacations and/or create income while you sleep. Notice that there is no timeline. This list isn’t designed to restrict your success or slow your progress as a coach. However, it is designed to inform your progress, because just like in martial arts you have to master the skills at each level before you can move to the next.

It is helpful as a coach to see these levels of progression because it actually gives you permission to slow down and take time to really master where you are. When you know what game you are playing, this model also allows you to play full out—at the level you’re at.

Use the “Litvin List” at the end of this book to determine your current level.

And remember: whichever level you’re at right now, we’ve all been there.
