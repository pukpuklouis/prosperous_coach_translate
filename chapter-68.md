## Five frogs are sitting on a log

by Rich and Steve

THERE’S AN OLD RIDDLE THAT says five frogs are sitting on a log. Four decide to jump off. How many are left?

What’s your answer?

Take your time.

No rush.

Take a moment to consider your answer.

How many are left?

The answer is five.

Why? Because four “decided” to jump off. That’s all they did. And there’s a big difference between deciding and doing.

We did not write this book just so you could have more information. Who really needs more information? If you’re a coach, and if you’re ready to actually jump off the log, this can be a book of transformation for you.

Just decide what tiny action you will take today to create your next client.

And then take it.

Don’t wait for one-hundred percent readiness. It will never come. When you are eighty percent ready, go for it. Run straight at it. Get exposed. Risk messing up.

Failing is not a problem you will face.

Failing is how you get there.
