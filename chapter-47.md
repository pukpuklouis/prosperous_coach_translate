# Coaching is NOT a luxury

by Rich

COACHING IS INCREASINGLY recognized as an essential part of professional and personal development.

Eric Schmidt, the CEO of Google, said, “Everyone needs a coach.” The Harvard Business Review reports that coaching is a one-billion-dollar-a-year industry.

A Manchester Consulting Group study of Fortune 100 executives reported that “coaching resulted in a Return On Investment of almost six times the program cost as well as improvements in relationships, teamwork, job satisfaction and quality.” And a recent survey by The Hay Group International stated that “between 25 and 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies use executive coaches.”

In the past coaching was seen as a luxury. But as we have faced a global economic downturn over the past few years, coaching is increasingly accepted as a necessity in order to develop your career, to get to the next level in your organization, to make more money or even to build better relationships.

So the challenge facing most coaches is not that there are too many coaches or that people do not want coaching. It’s that most coaches—even coaches at the very top of their game—do not know how to create high-paying, high-performing and highly committed clients.

Once you embrace that challenge and drop all the unwarranted pessimism around imaginary “competition” and “low demand,” your career will take off.
