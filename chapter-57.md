## Time to stop being so busy

by Steve

WHEN I’M IN CLIENT-CREATION MODE I have to remember that busyness is laziness. It’s lazy to be busy.

It’s lazy for me to occupy myself with all these small tasks when I know deep down that none of them will produce wealth. This “busywork” is an enemy to my financial success.

But there’s good news. Something I discovered really helped me with that. I began looking at my day, my list of things I wanted to do, and I asked myself which of these tasks will create income and which will not? I then put a star next to the things that would create income, and I gave those things my most focused, lavish, creative, committed and clever attention.

I mean, I really took my time with those. I slowed down and connected with the tasks and people that I starred on that list. It has never been a waste of time to do that.

Most busyness comes from our wild, ongoing attempts to please others. Notice I didn’t say serve others—I said to please them and win their ongoing approval. That kind of shallow, egocentric “busywork” is an enemy to your financial success.

Pleasing others is the real reason why people don’t succeed. And in the end pleasing others doesn’t win any respect from them either. So you lose both games. Be bold and hold to your boundaries. Look at the activities and people you have placed a star next to and choose them. Nourish those relationships slowly and creatively.
