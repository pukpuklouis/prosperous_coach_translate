How to fearlessly create a powerful coaching conversation

Litvin’s client creation formula

**Step 1. Connect**

How much time did you spend building/creating relationships with people in the past thirty days? Include things like phoning a colleague or old friend, networking events, dinners, parties, workshops, lunches, meeting for coffee, etc. Do not include building an email list, working on a website, time on Facebook, time on email, or writing a blog.

1. Do your research before even a first connection. Look them up on Google, LinkedIn and Facebook. Read their blog, their website or their book.
2. Get into an attitude of service.
3. Bring a sense of humor.
4. Adopt a spirit of curiosity.
5. Just connect. Ask them how they are. Ask about their life, ask about their business, ask about their relationships. Don’t get too intense if this is a first conversation, just be genuinely curious.
6. Ask what support they most need. Could you connect them with someone useful? Is there a book you could send them that would be just right for their current challenge?
7. If they ask about you, tell them what you are up to.
8. If this is the first time you have spoken to this person do not be in a rush to move to the next step. Building great relationships takes time. Be prepared to connect with this person many times over the next few months \(with a spirit of service\) before the time is right to ask the next question.

**Step 2. Invite**

How many potential clients did you invite to experience a Powerful Coaching Conversation with you in the past thirty days?

1. Even if you think you are speaking to a “dream client,” begin your question with the words, “Who do you know...?” Then get real specific. For example, if you coach women entrepreneurs who have run at least one successful business, you could say, “I have a space for one client right now and I only take on new clients by referral from people I trust. So who do you know who is an entrepreneur with a proven track record of success—but who is at this moment facing the challenge of transitioning to a new business?”
2. Then PAUSE... Bite your tongue if you need to. Give them space to think for a moment. If you’ve described their situation accurately, often the next words will be: “That’s me!”
3. “That’s me! How much do you charge?” If this is the response, resist the temptation to answer the question. Instead say, “Actually, my coaching is tailor-made. And I don’t even know if you really need long-term coaching right now. Instead let me block out two hours for you at a beautiful location, or even over the phone. Experience powerful life-changing coaching. At the end of the two hours you might be complete and not even need any more coaching. And if you’d like to know more at that point, and if it feels like a fit to both of us, we’ll talk.”
4. Then pull out your calendar and agree on a date and venue there and then.
5. “You should speak to so-and-so...” If this is the response \(instead of “that’s me!”\), resist the temptation to say, “Awesome! Give me her number, I’ll call her.” Instead slow down the conversation. Take your time to ask the following questions: “Thanks so much for the referral. Tell me, why do you think she would want coaching? Has she ever had coaching before? What’s her biggest gift? What’s her biggest challenge right now? How do you think coaching will benefit her most? How do you think she will respond if you tell her about coaching?”
6. If after all this it feels like a good fit, explain, “I want you to know that I never cold-call. But if you think she would get value from spending time with me, I will block out two hours with her. And please tell her that I am willing to do this as a gift, to her from you. Have her call or email me and say that she was referred by you. Will you do that?”

**Step 3. Create \(Your Magic\)**

How many potential clients did you spend time with in a powerful coaching conversation in the past thirty days? It only counts if you asked—and received—permission to coach them. Do not include time coaching a friend, colleague or family member where you were having a chat that turned into coaching. That is not the same as a powerful coaching experience.

This is where you get to do your magic. Show up powerfully. Dig deep to discover what they really, really want. Hold nothing back. Give them the best coaching experience they have ever had. Look for what they cannot see. And be bold enough to say to them what no one else will say.

**Step 4. Propose \(and Direct\)**

How much money did you make in Proposals in the past thirty days? A proposal is where you explicitly say to a person, “It will cost $X to work with me for Y months.” It’s a proposal when you find out what would be a Hell Yeah! for a potential client. It’s a proposal when you ask them: Hell Yeah! or No? It’s a proposal when you say, “This is how you make your payment. We begin the moment you send the money.”

1. Once again, don’t be in a rush. Making a proposal when you are creating a high-paying, high-performing client can require a depth of experience and relationship-building between the two of you over a significant period of time. I have seen this take over two years in some cases.
2. If you have got to the end of the coaching session and they have had a powerful insight or breakthrough, sometimes the very best thing to do is to sit in absolute silence and wait for them to speak first. If you have really rocked their world, this can last from five to thirty minutes. Say nothing.
3. If the silence has lasted long enough or they say, “Thank you” or “What next?” then you can say, “Would you like to hear a little bit about what it could look like for us to work together?” Remember, you cannot rush this. You are not selling a fifteen-dollar book; you are selling high-end coaching.
4. If they are ready to hear more, you can use The Litvin List above to craft a coaching program for them. Pick around five of the items and then relate them specifically to their challenges or goals. For example, “You want to transition smoothly to the role of CEO, so the first part of our work together will be to remove the fears, doubts and insecurities that are holding you back. Secondly, we will craft powerful goals that allow you to inspire and motivate your team. Next, we will review how you manage your energy from day to day. And finally we will help you build ways to ensure your relationship with your husband thrives in the midst of this new challenge. How does that sound to you? What else would we need to add to make this exactly the coaching program you are looking for?”
5. If you are relatively new to enrolling high-end clients then you must decide on your numbers well before this conversation begins. If you are experienced at this, you can make your numbers up on the spot, based on the program you are willing to offer. **Here are some examples of ways to make a proposal:** “Your investment will be $55,000 for a year of coaching. You pay up front and there are no refunds.” “It’s $30,000 to work with me for a year. But I am not offering that to you. Instead, I would like to create a ninety-day program for you. It is an $8,000 investment. If at the end of this time we both wish to continue, we will talk.” “I charge $12,000 for six months of coaching. But that’s not what you need right now. Instead, let’s get together for a full day. You will bring along your challenges and we will handle as many as we can in that day-long session. It’s $1,500 for the day. And I will include a follow-up coaching session by phone, one week later.”
6. Please, please, please practice saying your numbers out loud before the session. Say them to your husband. Say them to your kids. Say them to yourself in the bathroom mirror. But practice saying them out loud so much that they begin to roll off your tongue like your phone number.
7. When you have made your proposal, once again: slow down…
8. If they say they are in, challenge their “yes.” I know, it seems counterintuitive. But this is how you will create the most committed clients on the planet. “Are you sure I am not rushing you? Do you need to speak to your husband/wife first? This is an important decision; do you want to take some time to reflect?”
9. Then, this is how you complete a powerful proposal. Tell them:

   “This is what I require of you if you wish to work with me. You need to agree that you will never let fear get in the way of you taking action. It’s OK to feel fear—that’s called being human. You just won’t let it get in the way. You need to commit to being authentic with me and hiding nothing. And you need to agree to make all payments as agreed, no exceptions.

   “So let’s put a date on our calendar right now for when we speak next. That will become our first coaching session once you have signed up.

   “You are in once you send a check to me at this address… Or let me take your VISA card number.”
