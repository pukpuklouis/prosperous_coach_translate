## Learn to log in and log out

by Steve

NO SALE EVER TOOK PLACE outside of a conversation.

I remember years ago when I had to log in and log out.

When I woke up I kept a captain’s journal like in Star Trek, and when I spoke to someone I logged in. When I was finished, and now outside of the conversation, I logged out.

Like punching a time-clock. Blue collar. Because I knew that if I wanted to have my own business, every single moment I spent outside—logged out—of a conversation was a self-defeating waste of precious time and a deliberate self-destruction of my business. A lazy man’s cry for help is to passively fail to do what he knows would get the job done.

And my “laziness” was only fear.

Boy, I remember those days so well. Then, each day’s end I would report to my coach at the time, Lindsay Brady, exactly, down to the minute, how much time I’d spent logged in to my true work that day.

When I made those numbers, those minutes, increase, and then increase again, and then more and more, my business just totally took off.

Later I saw that minutes—actual minutes spent in conversation—were the final deciding factor, the final cause of my success. It was never some magic marketing bullet or appeal or anything else I’d been pining for.

It was a rough period for me. Some months my wife Kathy and I looked at less than two thousand dollars in income that month. Not ideal! But the turnaround came from logging in and not logging out.

Anyone can do this. Anyone willing to be fearless about logging your communication minutes each day.
