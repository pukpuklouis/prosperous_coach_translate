## Service: energy out = energy back

by Rich

THE UNIVERSE RELIES ON a simple principle: energy out equals energy back.

Creating clients works this way too. When you put your energy into total service, the energy flows back to you in the form of clients and wealth.

But—and this is important—you can never have an expectation that if you really serve someone they will become your client. That’s called being needy. You want instant gratification from the outside world instead of long-term strength-building inside you.

However, if you wake up every morning and answer the question, “Who can I serve?” you can then offer your attention and your energy to the first person who comes to mind. Now you connect with them. And you serve them. In the very best way you can.

You email them an article. You call to check in with them. You offer them a coaching review session as an ex-client. You look at their website and send them a book that will support their mission. Then let go of any needy attachment to them becoming a client, or even replying to your email or returning your call.

If you serve someone new every day, your world will transform as a coach.
