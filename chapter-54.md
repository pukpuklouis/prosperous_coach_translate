## Who are you being?

by Rich

WHO YOU ARE BEING SPEAKS far louder than how you describe what you do as a coach.

I recently walked past this sign store in Los Angeles and snapped a photo as I laughed out loud! The store has had a broken sign above its own shop for months now.

How would your coaching practice change if you were never again allowed to “tell” people what you do? What if, from now on, the only way for people to understand what you do is for them to experience the power of your coaching?

Most coaches end every conversation on the subject of money. Instead, always leave your conversations on the highest context of possibility.
